# MySocialNetwork
Twitter/Facebook clone

This is a simple project that I created using Django. The goal was to make an interactive social media site where users could make posts, comments, like/unlike posts,
and follow users. To get started, the user can create an account with a username and password. Once the account is created, the user can log in and begin making posts.
If you wanted to take things a step further, you have the option to customize your profile with a profile picture and banner. Then, everytime you make a post or comment,
your profile picture will be seen along with your name. On the home page, you will see the most recent posts that were made. From here, you have the option to interact
with the post or visit their page. If you visit their page, you can see all the posts that were made. Then, if you like the content they post, you have the option to follow
that user as well.
